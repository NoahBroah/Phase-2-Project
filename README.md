# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# References 

CSS styling for the majority of the homepage was strongly influenced by: https://www.codewithrandom.com/2022/08/13/personal-portfolio-website/#more-1558

CSS styling from boostrap was also used.


# Purpose

This Web Application was designed to be a professional experience website for myself. Users are able to leave testimonials on the website, and give feedback on past projects that we have worked on together. Users can also upload my resume and there are links to all of my social media.
